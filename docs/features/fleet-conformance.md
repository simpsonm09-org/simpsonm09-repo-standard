# Conformance

Conformance answers one question. Does this repository match the standard? Each
repository answers it about itself, from its own CI, with its own token. No
repository audits another, and there is no organization-wide audit or token.

## `check-standard`

[`../../scripts/check-standard.mjs`](../../scripts/check-standard.mjs) takes one
repository path and prints a compact matrix of nine tree-local groups.

| Group | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `files` | The required paths exist, including `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. |
| `mise` | `mise.toml` pins `aqua:casey/just`. |
| `ci` | `ci.yml` calls `lint`, `aislop`, `security`, and `standard` at a pinned 40-character SHA, and defines a `test` job that runs on a runner. |
| `dependabot` | `.github/dependabot.yml` declares version 2, a scheduled ecosystem, and no inline credential. |
| `community` | The byte-identical community files match the pinned standard. |
| `docs` | The [documentation layout](../documentation.md) holds. |
| `scripting` | Recipe bodies stay portable, scripts are declared or twinned, non-vendored skills call `just <recipe>`, and a repo-local skill id is in one skill root. |
| `env` | A root `.worktreeinclude` lists the local files, each is ignored by `.gitignore`, and every listed path has a committed sibling `.example`. |
| `subprocess` | Every `node:child_process` call in a source file passes a literal `windowsHide: true`, so Windows opens no empty console window. |

The script exits `1` when any group has a gap. It never reads the exception file, so
a single repository can be checked on its own.

### The `subprocess` group

The `subprocess` group is named for its scope, the child processes a Node script
starts. Its rule id is `subprocess/windows-hide`, and each gap prints `file:line`. It
reads each `.mjs`, `.js`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.mts`, and `.cts` file in the working tree,
except `node_modules`, `.git`, and vendored PStack skills, which the scripting group
also exempts.

The scan is token-based, so it needs no parser dependency. It follows a
`node:child_process` binding through a static, namespace, default, destructured,
renamed, `require`, or dynamic `import` form, and a name defaulted or assigned
straight from one of its functions (`spawn = spawnSync`). A call fails when:

- it has no options, or its options are a callback alone;
- its options are a variable, so the key cannot be read;
- its options object does not set `windowsHide: true` as a literal; or
- a spread follows that key, because the spread could override it.

The scan does not follow any other function value. A child_process function stored
in a variable, passed as an argument, or read from a property is not checked, and
neither is a member call written with a string key, `cp['spawn'](`. A method that
shares a name with an imported child_process function is read as a call.
Fix a finding by writing the options as a literal object in the call.

## `check-repo`

[`../../scripts/check-repo.mjs`](../../scripts/check-repo.mjs) runs `check-standard`
and then adds the checks a repository can make about itself through the GitHub API
with its own token. It reads the identity from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` or the `--repo`
flag, and it applies the subset of [`../exceptions.json`](../exceptions.json) that
names the repository.

The API groups are `settings` and `ruleset`.

- `settings` requires the default branch to be `main`, the description to be set, and
  the owner topic to be present.
- `ruleset` requires `protect-main` on a public repository.

A repository cannot read its own secret scanning, push protection, or merge methods
with its own token, so those are applied once and not audited. See
[github-settings.md](../github-settings.md).

## The reusable workflow

[`../../.github/workflows/standard.yml`](../../.github/workflows/standard.yml) is the
entry point. It checks out the caller and this repository at the caller's pinned SHA,
then runs `check-repo` with the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A repository adopts a new
standard by bumping its pin. See [adoption.md](../adoption.md).

Gaps tolerated for a reason are listed in [`../exceptions.json`](../exceptions.json).
Every other gap fails the command with exit `1`.
